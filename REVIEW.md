# Privacy Curtain Extension - Code Review

## Issues Found

### 1. **Manifest.json Issues**
- Missing `16`, `32`, `48` icon sizes - only has `128`
- Inconsistent extension name ("Blur Toggle Extension" vs "Privacy Curtain")

### 2. **Background Script Problems**
The background.js appears to be legacy code that conflicts with the main functionality:
- Uses old `toggleBlur` function that only targets WhatsApp
- Conflicts with the React popup's comprehensive platform support
- Has outdated blur logic

### 3. **React Component Issues**
- `outlookToggles` array is undefined (line 155 in App.jsx:155)


### 4. **Content Script Concerns**
- Very long file with complex platform-specific selectors
- No error handling for failed DOM queries
- Missing validation for Chrome APIs availability

### 5. **Build Configuration**
- No extension-specific build optimization
- Missing proper output configuration for extension structure

## Recommendations

**High Priority:**
1. Fix `outlookToggles` undefined reference
2. Simplify or remove conflicting background.js
3. Add proper error handling in content script
4. Complete manifest.json icon configuration

**Medium Priority:**
1. Split content.js into platform-specific modules
2. Add TypeScript for better type safety
3. Implement proper extension build pipeline
4. Add unit tests for core functionality

**Low Priority:**
1. Optimize CSS selector specificity
2. Add user feedback for failed operations
3. Implement settings export/import
4. Add extension update notifications

## Overall Assessment
The core functionality is solid, but these fixes would improve reliability and maintainability significantly.
